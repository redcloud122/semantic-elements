Semantic elements are HTML tags that clearly describe their meanings to both browsers and developers, unlike non-semantic ones such as <div> and <span>, telling nothing about their contents.  The main semantic elements for larger document outlines are <header>, <nav>, <aside>, <section>, <article>, <footer>.  Further, a <section> can have its own <header>, <footer>, and <nav>.  By clearly conveying the outline, the elements enhance a web page’s accessibility, searchability, interoperability, and internationalization.  Other semantics elements include:  <main>, <figure>, <summary>, <mark>, <time>, <video> etc, as one may tell easily what each of those is for.  Developers should use sematic elements such as <nav> instead of <div id=”nav”>.
